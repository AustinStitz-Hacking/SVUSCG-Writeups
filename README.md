# SVUSCG-Writeups

Welcome to my writeups from the Season V US Cyber Open CTF! If you'd like to see my writeups from Season IV, feel free to check them out [here](https://github.com/AustinStitz-Hacking/SIVUSCG-Writeups)!

The US Cyber Open CTF consisted of both the Beginner's Game Room and the Competitive CTF and is the first major event of the US Cyber Games program each year. The [US Cyber Games Program](https://www.uscybergames.com/) governs the US Cyber Team and US Women's Cyber Team, who each compete internationally in competitions including the International Cybersecurity Challenge and the European Cybersecurity Challenge. Additionally, the US Cyber Games runs the annual Pipeline Program, which I had the privilege of being a part of during Season IV, leading to one of my challenges (NinjaNote) being included in the Beginner's Game Room! The US Cyber Open CTF is the first of several steps in applying to join one of the main US Cyber Taems or the Pipeline Program, which also includes the invite-only US Cyber Combine and a process of interviews. From what I've seen this past year since first encountering it during last year's Open, the program is amazing, and if you are here and didn't get the chance to participate in this year's Open, I would absolutely recommend it for next year, and I would also absolutely recommend the Combine and Pipeline Program for anyone who has the chance to participate! 

The US Cyber Open CTF lasted for a little over two weeks, and during that time, I was able to solve 36 challenges, including all 16 Beginner's Game Room challenges (and two challenges that were added to the category but worth zero points since they were added late), both of the Warmup challenges, 6 Forensics challenges, 4 Web challenges, both Misc challenges, 3 Crypto challenges, and 1 Reverse Engineering challenge. With these, I gained a total of 5016 points between both categories, including 3416 points in the Competitive CTF and 1800 in the Beginner's Game Room. I placed 26th in the Competitive CTF, 4th in the Beginner's Game Room, and 20th combined, pending the scoreboard being officially finalized.
